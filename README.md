# clean-up-crunchyroll

Currently, anime titles are displayed twice or three times in the Crunchyroll simulcast calendar when they are released in multiple languages. This extension cleans up the simulcast calendar and only displays the first entry for each anime title per day.

## How to use the Extention

The extention is NOT evailable on the Chrome Web Store. However, you can load the extention locally.
(To create a Chrome Web Store-Developer Account, you haveto pay 5 $ registration fee ... I'm not ready to do this right now for a fun account.)

How to Load an Extension Locally
1. Clone this repoitory.
2. In your browser, go to: `chrome://extensions/`
3. Toggle Developer mode on (top right of the page).
4. Click the Load unpacked button.
5. In the file dialog, select the cloned repository folder.

The Extension is Now Installed! :D
It will appear in your list of extensions and be active immediately.
Any changes you make to the source files can be refreshed by clicking the Reload icon next to the extension in the Extensions page.
